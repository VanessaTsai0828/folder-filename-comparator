# Folder Filename Comparator
Dataset consistency check between two folders based on filenames.

## What it does
- Compare filenames (non-recursive)
- Show files that exist only in Folder 1 / Folder 2
- Filename-level comparison only (no file content diff)

## Typical use cases
- Verify file copy / backup completeness
- Document handover checking
- Dataset consistency check

## Notes
- Subfolders are ignored
- File content is NOT compared
